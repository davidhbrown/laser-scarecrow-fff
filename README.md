Files for 3D-printed (Fused Filament Fabrication) parts related to Dr. Rebecca Brown's research on the URI Laser Scarecrow

At this time, we do not intend to provide original design files. 

The STL files were printed primarily on a Original Prusa I3 Mk2.5S using a 0.6mm nozzle and three perimeters. 

We used ASA filament for all parts for its heat and UV resistance. ABS could be used for parts that are within the bucket.
